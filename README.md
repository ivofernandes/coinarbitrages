# Coin arbitrages
This project was done during the fantastic crypto currency bubble of january 2018. 

It is a very simple app that fire alarms each time trading opportunities emerge due to different prices in different exchanges. So I had Euros and Ethereum/Bitcoin in Kraken, GDAX and Bitstamp.

For example, I could had Ethereum in GDAX, and Euros in Kraken. If the price in GDAX was above 0.7% of the price in Kraken, it worth it to sell in GDAX and buy on Kranken at the same time. Keeping the same amount of crypto and making some euros in the process. And as the market fultuates so much there were appearing also opportunities to reverse the trade selling in Kraken and buying on GDAX. I think it's not working anymore, probably because to many people are doing the same thing now. 

But feel free to explore and submit pull requests if you want to :)
